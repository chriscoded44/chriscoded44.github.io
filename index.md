## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, part 1
This assignment is forever one of my favorites despite it being by far the simplest of the labs. It is very reminiscent and a reminder of how far I've come. In retrospect it is interesting to see where I found the most difficulty and how now that I know the correct formation of a string I can write any code using the same format or slightly tweaked to show my knowledge of code.

Lab 7, part 2
The lab 7 assignments were very enjoyable to me because it was around the time I was becoming more familiar with the difficult parts of code and wrapping my head around these puzzles was fun. In particular the black jack game was cool because black jack has always been a fascination of mine and after all was said and done I still found myself contemplating different outcomes with different code. For example, a program which can count cards and predict outcomes resulting in better decision making against the dealer. 

Lab 5, part 1
Loops have been challenging for me especially for loops. For some reason something was always wrong with my code but because it was so challenging it is that much more rewarding to say that I can now do it. In particular numbers tend to confuse me when in repetition but visualizing the route of the for loop helped me better understand the movement of the code. Loops are possibly the most useful pieces of code available and I am proud to say I understand the basic possibilities.
